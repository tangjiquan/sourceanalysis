/**
 * A worker thread class which can drain channels and echo-back the input. Each
 * instance is constructed with a reference to the owning thread pool object.
 * When started, the thread loops forever waiting to be awakened to service the
 * channel associated with a SelectionKey object. The worker is tasked by
 * calling its serviceChannel() method with a SelectionKey object. The
 * serviceChannel() method stores the key reference in the thread object then
 * calls notify() to wake it up. When the channel has been drained, the worker
 * thread returns itself to its parent pool.
